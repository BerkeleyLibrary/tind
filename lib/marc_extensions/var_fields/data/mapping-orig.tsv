Field	Retain?	Incoming Subfields	TIND Subfields	Label	MARC Definition	Instructions	Comments / Details
• All TIND fields should have both indicators set to blank, except where specially noted in column 1. • Incoming subfields (column 3) do not indicate a specific order. Subfields should be processed in the order in which they appear in the MARC record. • TIND subfields (column 4) do indicate an order. Add or combine subfields using this order

Use only 4-digit years - drop other date formats, e.g., 19uu, etc.	Specific dates are the dates of an issue of a periodical, date of a specific photo, etc. The more specific date should be used in 260/269. Use dates from 008 as a date of "last resort". 269 is highly desirable but not required when date is unknown
